## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it using online password strength tools to evaluate its security.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com)
- [Security.org Password Checker](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
- [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://www.kaspersky.com/password-check)

## ðŸ“‹ Steps Performed

1. **Created Multiple Passwords**
   - Generated 5 different passwords with varying complexity (simple to complex).

2. **Applied Password Best Practices**
   - Used combinations of:
     - Uppercase and lowercase letters
     - Numbers
     - Special characters
     - Length variation (from 8 to 16+ characters)

3. **Tested Passwords Using Online Tools**
   - Each password was entered into the checkers.
   - Collected scores, estimated time to crack, and suggestions.

4. **Noted Observations**
   - Weak passwords scored low and could be cracked quickly.
   - Strong passwords had long cracking times and high scores.

5. **Identified Key Learnings**
   - Length and diversity of characters significantly increase strength.
   - Avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns.

6. **Studied Common Attacks**
   - **Brute Force:** Tries every combination.
   - **Dictionary Attack:** Tries common words and leaked passwords.

7. **Summarized Findings**
   - Password complexity and length are crucial for resisting attacks.
   - Strong passwords should be at least 12 characters long and contain diverse elements.
