Summary of Learning – Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

1. What Makes a Password Strong:
A strong password includes a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and is typically at least 12–16 characters long. It should not contain dictionary words, personal information, or predictable patterns.

2. Observations from Password Testing:
During testing, I found that simple passwords like "password123" were marked as weak and could be cracked instantly. On the other hand, passwords with a mix of characters and longer lengths, such as "H@ckM3IfYouCan#2025", received high scores and showed longer estimated crack times.

3. Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords:
- Use at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter
- Include numbers and special characters (!, @, #, etc.)
- Make the password at least 12 characters long
- Avoid using common words, names, or birthdates
- Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords

4. How Password Complexity Affects Security:
Complex passwords increase the number of possible combinations, which makes them much harder to guess or crack. Longer and more complex passwords significantly reduce the risk of successful brute-force or dictionary attacks.

5. Common Password Attacks:
- Brute Force Attack: Tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found. Stronger passwords take much longer to crack.
- Dictionary Attack: Uses lists of common or leaked passwords to guess the correct one. These attacks are more effective on simple or predictable passwords.

Conclusion:
Through this activity, I learned the importance of using complex and unique passwords for better security. Testing passwords using online tools helped me understand what makes a password strong and how to protect against common attack methods.
